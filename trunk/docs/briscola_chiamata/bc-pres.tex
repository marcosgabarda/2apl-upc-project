    5 players, 8 cards each, no cards undealt

    \vskip 2.0ex

    Phases of the game:
    \begin{itemize}  
      \item Card giving
      \item Bidding
      \item Partner selection
      \item Playing cards
      \item Winner/Loser declaration with point distribution
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Uncertainity (nobody knows who is actually its partner)
    \item Sociality (its needed in order to discover partners/cheat opponents)
    \item Coordination is needed
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Cooperation inside teams needed once partners are discovered
      \item Competition between teams needed once partners are discovered
    \end{itemize}
    \item Trust/Reputation models needed 
    \item Main agent properties are satisfied
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Autonomy (players are autonomous, they plan alone once there are at least 5 players)
      \item Flexibility
      \item Reactivity (players has to play when its their turn)
      \item Proactivity (players can decide if they want to play even if it's not their turn, players can decide to start cheating other players by sending them messages)
      \item Social (players have to interact with each others in order to discover their partners)
    \end{itemize}
