== Game Phases ==
Game phases :
   **Card giving phase**
   **Bidding phase**
   **Partner selection phase**
   **Game phase**
   **Winner/Loser phase**
   **Point distribution phase**
   
if (player achieves max amount of points) 
   **Victor phase**
else
   restart phases.
   
-------------------------------------------------

== Scenario ==

  * 5 players (3 against 2)
  * Game split into 2 phases
    * 1st phase: partners are chosen (but actually nobody knows who is its partner)
    * 2st phase: card game
  * Only looking at the game in the second phase, players can start believing who is its partner




== What make SMA a suitable solution ==

  * Uncertainity (nobody knows who is actually its partner)
  * Sociality (its needed in order to discover partners/cheat opponents)
  * Cooperation inside teams needed once partners are discovered
  * Competition between teams needed once partners are discovered
  * Trust/Reputation models needed 

=== Main agent properties ==
  * Autonomy (players are autonomous, they plan alone once there are at least 5 players)
  * Flexibility
    * Reactivity (players has to play when its their turn)
    * Proactivity (players can decide if they want to play even if it's not their turn, players can decide to start cheating other players by sending them messages)
    * Social (players have to interact with each others in order to discover their partners)

=== Environment properties ===
  * The environment is basically the table 
    * fully accessible (all the players can watch to all the cards on the table)
    * deterministic (playing cards cannot fail, simplicistic view but can work)
    * episodic (if i play a card, then i don't have that card anymore)
    * dynamic (players can play their cards even if it is not its turn)
    * discrete (it's a matter of philosophy ;-)
